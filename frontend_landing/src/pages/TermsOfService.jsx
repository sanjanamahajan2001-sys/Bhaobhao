            <strong>(vii)</strong> Charges and Fees that you pay are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise
            determined by FF or required by the applicable laws. Under certain laws, you may be
            entitled to a refund or other remedies for a failure in the provision of the Services.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>(viii)</strong> You acknowledge and agree that Charges and Fees applicable in certain
            geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. FF will use
            reasonable efforts to inform you of the Charges and Fees that may apply. However, by

            <strong>(c) Payment Processors:</strong> We may use a third-party payment processor ("Payment
            Processor") to bill you through your selected mode of payment. The processing of
            payments will be subject to the terms and policies of such Payment Processor in

            cancellation fee.
          </p>

          <p>

            Services. You agree that subscription packages (howsoever named) shall be subject to

          <p>
            <strong>(f)</strong> FF does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Service
            Professional. Any representation by FF to the effect that tipping is "voluntary", "not
            required", and/or "included" in the payments you make for Grooming Services is not
            intended to suggest that FF provides any additional payments to Service Professionals.
            You understand and agree that while you are free to provide additional payment as a
            gratuity to any Service Professional who provides you with Grooming Services, you are

            them, or you behave towards them in a manner which is discourteous, disrespectful,
            abusive, or otherwise inappropriate. We reserve the right to withhold access to the
            Services and otherwise limit your access to Grooming Services at our absolute
            discretion if you behave towards any Service Professional in a manner which is

            Terms will continue to be in effect. If any unlawful or unenforceable provision would
            be lawful or enforceable if a part of it were deleted, that part will be deemed to be
            deleted, and the rest of the provision will continue in effect (unless that would
            contradict the clear intention of the clause, in which case the entirety of the relevant
            provision will be deemed to be deleted).
